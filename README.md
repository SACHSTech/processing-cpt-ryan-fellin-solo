# Great Cave Escape
# A Celeste-Styled platform game created by Ryan Fellin

On an expedition to explore a previously undiscovered section of an archeological dig, our protagonist, the Cave Explorer, is trapped inside when a wall collapses in on itself.
He then finds himself in an ancient temple, where the only way out of the cave, is up through the perilous gauntlet of trials set out by the ancients that created them
Your Objective: Help the cave explorer escape the perils of the great cave, or die trying
Will you escape from the endless void below, or fail and remain trapped within this forbidden domain forever...

# Objective:
The objective of the game is to reach the end of each of the 4 levels to escape the cave, each stage requires pinpoint accuracy and your honed mastery of the game to complete each of the 4 challenges and win.

# Controls:
Your main movement controls are found on the W, A, S, D, and L keys
A and D move your character left and right respectively, W makes the character jump, and s makes the explorer drop down
L causes your character to dash quickly in the last direction that you walked in, this can be used to dash through the air and reach far-off platforms which seem inaccessible

# Scoring
This game does not include a scoring system, to win the game, the player must complete the 4 stages, failing will result in them beginning again from the start of that level, therefore no point scoring system is required.

# Limitations
There are some locations that may clip the player character out of bounds, however these situations are rare occurrences, and will only really happen if you try to clip through.

# Notes
While the game itself may look simple, it is powered by many extremely complex subsystems and methods to make your playing experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible, such as multi-key input and the VelocityEngine backend.
